          Hello! My name is Bradley and have recently begun the journey to become a Full Stack Software Engineer. I have been the CEO of a tech start-up for the past 15 years and feel as though itâ€™s time for me to expand my knowledge and experience of software engineering. My interest and first exposure to the internet began with America Online in the late 80s and has stuck with me ever since!
        </p>    
        <p id="two">
          Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working in the senior leadership team of United Airlines in various leadership roles. I am also currently the CEO of a start-up that has grown all over the world. My main focus is to continue to build and develop my knowledge and experience of being a software engineer and exploring opportunities!
